Virtual Vinli Service
=====================

Use the Virtual Vinli service to get sample vehicle data for your app. With virtual vehicle data, you can test, prototype, and learn the Vinli platform. It's simple.

1. Get dummy device data from the Virtual Vinli service.

2. Add the dummy device to your `MyVinli`_ account, under New Device.

3. Get the available routes from the Virtual Vinli service.

4. Select and run a route. You now have a virtual vehicle generating data.

5. Use standard Vinli services to do test and prototype with the data.
